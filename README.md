# Baseball Game
Hello World.  It's pretty simple, catch(click) the falling baseballs as they come down.  If the baseballs touch the bottom of the screen you get a strike.  3 strikes and you're out!

# Pseudocoding/Process
Make a game that:
* Has baseballs falling down.
* Have to catch(click) before they get to a certain point.
* 3 strikes and game ends.
* Should log strikes and outs.
